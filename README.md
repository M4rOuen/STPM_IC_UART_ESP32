The STPM3x is an ASSP family designed for high
accuracy measurement of power and energies in
power line systems using the Rogowski coil,
current transformer or shunt current sensors. The
STPM3x provides instantaneous voltage and
current waveforms and calculates RMS values of
voltage and currents, active, reactive and
apparent power and energies. The STPM3x is a
mixed signal IC family consisting of an analog and
a digital section. The analog section consists of
up to two programmable gain low-noise low-offset
amplifiers and up to four 2nd order 24-bit sigmadelta ADCs, two bandgap voltage references with
independent temperature compensation, a low
drop voltage regulator and DC buffers. The digital
section consists of digital filtering stage, a
hardwired DSP, DFE to the input and a serial
communication interface (UART or SPI). The
STPM3x is fully configurable and allows a fast
digital system calibration in a single point over the
entire current dynamic range.
